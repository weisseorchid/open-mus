# Open Mus 🎴

A cinematic, minimalist landing page inspired by the classic mus card game. Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

Idea, later on is to generate a Playtomic-like style competition to improve pairing logic from existing alternatives.

Goal is to improve existing free mus options as: 
- [https://mus.las40.es/](https://mus.las40.es/)
- 

🚀 **Live (development):** Check [open-mus-development.up.railway.app](https://open-mus-development.up.railway.app/)

## ⚡️ Tech Stack
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

## 🤝 Contributing
- Please branch off from `development` for all contributions.
- All pull requests require approval before merging.
- No dedicated backend: we use Supabase for all core features (auth, data, etc.).
- PRs that propose a custom backend will not be accepted. Game logic will live in the frontend.

Thanks for helping us keep things simple! 🙏
